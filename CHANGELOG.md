## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Docker support — multi-container setup with nginx (frontend) + Node.js (backend)
- backend/Dockerfile, frontend/Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, .env.example, .dockerignore
- INSTALL.md — unified installation guide covering all 4 options (Windows native, Docker, Windows .exe coming, Mac coming)
- FOCUSBOARD_KEY env var — stable encryption key for containers (overrides machine-bound key)
- FOCUSBOARD_DOCKER=true — tells backend it's behind nginx with unexposed port; skips localhost auth check
- nginx security headers: CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
- Release workflow now builds and pushes focusboard-frontend and focusboard-backend images to GHCR
- CI validates docker-compose.yml syntax and builds both images on every push

- **Application error codes** — `backend/error-codes.js` with 35 named constants (e.g. `JIRA_VPN_REQUIRED`, `GOOGLE_AUTH_EXPIRED`); every `logger.error/warn` call now includes a `code` field at the top level of the log entry for easy filtering
- **`docs/error-codes.md`** — reference document covering all 35 codes, Windows Scheduled Task exit codes, Node.js exit codes, and crash investigation PowerShell one-liners
- **37 new tests** — `gmail-feedback.test.js` (input validation, sender extraction, noise patterns), `watchdog.test.js` (route shapes, PowerShell command safety), `week-navigation.test.ts` (offset logic, boundaries), `leaderboard.test.ts` (medals, streaks, ranking), `confidence-dots.test.ts` (level thresholds); total now 208

### Fixed
- Server exits with a clear error message if FOCUSBOARD_DOCKER=true but FOCUSBOARD_KEY not set (previously would silently use unstable container hostname as key)
- 76 backend tests (14 new docker-mode tests covering key derivation, auth bypass, startup validation)
- Gmail feedback endpoint now validates `taskId` type/length and clamps `from`/`subject` to 500 chars and `confidence` to 0–1 before persisting noise patterns
- Removed three unused variables: `E` import in `claude.js`, `BG_BLUE` in `startup.js`, `Section` component in `SettingsPage.tsx` — eliminates persistent lint warnings

---

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Email Intelligence** — Gmail items now show Claude confidence dots (●●● / ●●○ / ●○○), hover to see raw email snippet, "Not an action" 👎 button dismisses and teaches the noise filter, learned patterns injected into Claude prompt on next sync
- **Week navigation** — ‹ › arrows in the Focus week view to move between weeks; "This week" button to jump back; current week highlighted in blue
- **Friendly startup** — human-readable terminal banner with integration status (✓ connected / ○ not configured / ○ disabled), actionable warnings, no raw JSON on startup
- **Watchdog friendly output** — watchdog process uses same clean terminal style

### Fixed
- Settings page components (`Toggle`, `IntegrationSection`, `TestButton`) moved to module scope — eliminates remount-on-every-keypress bug that made Settings inaccessible

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Watchdog process** (`backend/watchdog.js`) — separate lightweight process on port 3002 that can restart FocusBoard on demand; registered as the `FocusBoardWatchdog` scheduled task
- **Offline recovery page** (`frontend/public/offline.html`) — shown by the service worker when the main server is unreachable; includes a one-click restart button that calls the watchdog
- **Nightly backups** (`backend/backup.js`, `backend/restore.js`) — all app data saved nightly as a gzipped JSON bundle to `backend/backups/`; registered as the `FocusBoardBackup` scheduled task; old bundles auto-pruned
- **Watcher heartbeat indicator** — notification watcher pings `/api/health/watcher/ping` every 10 seconds; sidebar shows 🟢 (alive) or 🔴 (stopped) so notification outages are immediately visible
- **API Cutover date** — Settings → Integrations tab with a date picker to limit how far back each API fetches
- **Completed history log** — tasks moved to Done are written to `backend/data/completed-history.json` for use in the weekly report
- **Privacy mode** — 👁 eye icon in the header blurs all on-screen content for demos and screen sharing; click again to reveal
- **`/api/report/done-tasks` endpoint** — reconstructs weekly done-task history from Jira API and the completed-history log
- **Feature toggles** — Settings → Integrations tab; each source has a toggle in its header; disabled sources are skipped entirely during sync
- **Settings sub-tabs** — Settings page split into Integrations (credentials + toggles) and App (appearance, maintenance)
- **Productivity leaderboard** — click the 🏆 trophy to see daily high scores, personal best ⭐, current streak 🔥, and all-time total
- **New high score fireworks** — confetti burst + "New High Score!" banner when you beat your personal best
- **Fix version filter** — dropdown in the header nav auto-selects the current quarter; Quick Add tasks are stamped with the selected fix version
- **Calendar item expand on hover** — week view task titles expand to full text on hover; collapse when you move away
- **Friendly VPN warning** — when Jira is unreachable due to a network error, a clear amber banner explains the likely cause and offers a one-click sync retry
- **Clear cache & reload button** — Settings → App → Maintenance; unregisters the service worker and clears all cached assets in one click
- **119 automated tests** — 34 back-end + 85 front-end across 15 suites; new suites for VPN detection, feature toggle filtering, fix version logic

### Fixed
- **Weekly report** — now uses `/api/report/done-tasks` so history survives server restarts and daily resets
- **Trophy midnight reset** — counter checks every minute and resets correctly when the date changes
- **Network crash** — server now binds to `127.0.0.1` only, preventing crashes when WiFi or VPN interfaces change
- **Settings page remounting** — `Toggle`, `IntegrationSection`, and `TestButton` moved to module scope so React no longer recreates them on every render

---
